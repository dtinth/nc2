> Web based notecharter of the future


## Rough Plan

- Notechart editor in its own format based on bmson (which is in turn based on JSON).
- Can be modified to work with multiple type of games.
- Column-based (like BMSE or iBMSC).
- Using gestures like FL Studio.
- Package as Electron app.
- Built using React and Redux.
- Tested using Karma and Mocha.


## Running

To start the server, run:

```bash
$ npm start
```


## Building

To build for production, this command will output optimized production code:

```bash
$ npm run build
```
